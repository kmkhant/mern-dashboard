# Full-Stack Admin Dashboard
Admin Dashboard using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. 

Frontend is implemented by
  - React with ReduxToolkit for state management, RTK Query for data fetching, MaterialUI for UI design & responsive design and clean typescript for effective development.

Backend is powered by 
  - ExpressJS in a mvc(model-view-controller) pattern without views ( no need to implement view due to frontend react implementation ).
